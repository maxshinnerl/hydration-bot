# General tips:
1) When starting, run $sudo apt-get update, followed by $sudo apt-get install python3-pip.  Remember to use python3 and pip3 (include the 3)

2) for logging on, do ssh -i <path to pem file in ~/keypairs> ubuntu@publicip (see aws)

3) Downloading and building manifest is too heavy for AWS.  Do on local computer
and transfer via Github (you get too big warnings but it's fine)

4) don't forget to set the variables in the bash profile (keys)

5) tmux as a daemon instead of gunicorn

   - $tmux

       - starts a new window
       - inside this window, run script and exit with ctrl+B then D 
       - it will stay running, even after exiting
       - note that terminating ec2 instance *will* kill it

   - $tmux attach

       - run to go back inside and see the running script

Packages needed (aside from pip and stuff):
discord
python-dotenv
numpy
requests
matplotlib

other weirdos:
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

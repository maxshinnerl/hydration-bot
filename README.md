# hydration-bot
A project by Max Shinnerl (ign EatYoWaffles)

Main goal: merging of the Discord and Destiny 2 API's to allow users to query Destiny 2 data through Discord bot commands.

Currently supported commands (available by the $help commands):

For all members:
 General:
 - $flirt    -- send a funny message to someone
 - $help     -- display list of currently available commands
 - $usage    -- Give usage advice for a specified command.
 - $sausage  -- ?

 Destiny Specific:
 - $weapstat -- show stats of a specified Destiny 2 weapon
 - $recoil   -- recommend counterbalance mod for specified Destiny 2 weapon
 - $compare  -- Show comparison of two specified weapons (visualization)
 - $sametype -- Get all weapons in the game of the same archetype of given weapon

 Note: Destiny Specific commands are CASE SENSITIVE
 TIP: Look in collections for correct capitalization.

For admins:
 - $move     -- move all members from one voice channel to another

In beta:
 - $joinleave -- have hydration bot join and leave voice channel

For instructions on using commands, see $usage.
Example: $usage $flirt

For MEE6 bot (music, etc), type !help
